# CLI files scrambler

Ever wanted to scramble your files to randomize them in the folder? Then this CLI software is for you.

Why would you do this? If you have an old USB song player that does not randomize music, you can randomize the files and you are set. Or you just need tham scrambled for reasons.

**Note:** This CLI software renames the files. The original name is maintained, but a random 5 character string is added to the beginning of the name. For example, `my_song.mp3` can become `KsJKd_my_song.mp3`.

Written in pure Python 3.

## Usage

```
python3 cli_files_scrambler.py --folder "[absolute_folder_path]"
```
